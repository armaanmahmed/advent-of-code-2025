# Overview
My solutions were implemented in Python.  
In terms of approach, I tried to optimize for asymptotic complexity but would occasionally benchmark to see if certain optimizations were worthwhile.  Many of these problems, especially part 1, admit a brute-force approach.

I had fun participating and look forward to next year, perhaps with a different language!
